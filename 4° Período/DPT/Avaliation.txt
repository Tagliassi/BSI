SQL Diagnostic Assessment

Part I: Basic SQL Concepts

1. What is SQL?
    Answer: SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It is essential for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data within a database, as well as defining the structure of the data.

2. Difference between DDL and DML?
    Answer: DDL (Data Definition Language) is used to define and manage the structure of databases (e.g., CREATE). DML (Data Manipulation Language) is used to manipulate the data within the tables (e.g., INSERT).

3. What is normalization?
    Answer: Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity and efficiency.

Part II: Basic Queries

1. Query to select all clients.
    Answer: SELECT * FROM clients;

2. Insert a record into products (id, name, price).
    Answer: INSERT INTO products (id, name, price) VALUES (id_value, 'name_value', price_value);

3. Update price to 19.99 where id = 5.
    Answer: UPDATE products SET price = 19.99 WHERE id = 5;

4. Delete client where id = 3.
    Answer: DELETE FROM clients WHERE id = 3;

Part III: Intermediate Queries

1. Select sales after January 1, 2023.
    Answer: SELECT * FROM sales WHERE sale_date > '2023-01-01';

2. Join between clients and sales to get client name and sale date.
    Answer: SELECT clients.name, sales.sale_date FROM clients JOIN sales ON clients.id = sales.client_id;

3. Total sales amount per client.
    Answer: SELECT clients.name, SUM(sales.sale_amount) AS total_sales FROM clients JOIN sales ON clients.id = sales.client_id GROUP BY clients.name;

Part IV: Query Optimization

1. What is an index?
    Answer: An index is a data structure that enhances the speed of data retrieval, thereby improving query performance.

2. Optimize query with price > 100.
    Answer: Create an index on the price column.

3. What is an execution plan (EXPLAIN)?
    Answer: An execution plan is a report generated by the EXPLAIN command that shows how a query will be executed, helping to identify and optimize bottlenecks.

Part V: Practical Exercise

1. Query to return client names and total sales amount, ordered by total sales in descending order.
    Answer: SELECT clients.name, SUM(sales.sale_amount) AS total_sales FROM clients JOIN sales ON clients.id = sales.client_id GROUP BY clients.name ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
    Answer: `SELECT clients.name, sales.sale_date FROM clients JOIN sales ON clients.id = sales.client_id;`
